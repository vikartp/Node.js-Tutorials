# ECMAScript and JavaScript

## Historical Background

### The Birth of JavaScript (1995)
In **1995**, **Netscape** created JavaScript as a scripting language for web browsers. This marked the beginning of dynamic web development.

### Browser Wars and Fragmentation
Microsoft reverse-engineered Netscape's JavaScript to create **JScript**, which led to differences in implementation between browsers. This fragmentation created compatibility issues for developers.

## Standardization Efforts

### ECMA International Involvement (1996)
To standardize JavaScript and resolve browser compatibility issues, Netscape submitted JavaScript to **ECMA International** in **1996**.

### The ECMAScript Standard
ECMA International created the **ECMAScript standard (ECMA-262)** and established a committee (**TC39**) to maintain and evolve the specification.

## ECMAScript vs JavaScript

### Key Differences
- **ECMAScript**: The official language specification that defines the syntax, types, statements, keywords, and objects
- **JavaScript**: The implementation that builds on top of ECMAScript, adding additional features and APIs

### Relationship

```

## Evolution and Versions

### Modern JavaScript Features
Over time, ECMAScript has released various versions, with significant milestones including:

- **ES2015** (also known as **ES6**): Introduced modern JavaScript features like:
  - Arrow functions
  - Classes
  - Template literals
  - Destructuring
  - Modules
  - And many more...

### Ongoing Development
The TC39 committee continues to evolve the specification with annual releases, ensuring JavaScript remains modern and powerful.

## Practical Note

> ðŸ’¡ **For this tutorial series**: You can treat ECMAScript and JavaScript as the same thing, as the two terms are often used interchangeably in everyday development.
